# Dev Butler

## Make

We are using "make" in order to build our releases. Check the Makefile.toml 
to see the task and tooling.

install cargo make:

```
    cargo install cargo-make
```

- On windows if you are having problems try installing cygwin with gcc lib 
  and then run it from the terminal.

## Flutter Sandbox

In the the 'flutter_sandbox' directory you will find the sandbox flutter 
project on which you can manually test Butler on a Flutter project.
